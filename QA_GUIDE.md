## Getting Started

CBZ API Delta is a tool for comparing API responses between production and staging environments across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Mobile Web, Desktop Web) and geographic locations (IN, US, CA, AE).

### Key Features

- **Multi-Geo Testing**: Tests APIs across multiple geographic locations using the `cb-loc` header
- **Limited Concurrency**: Caps concurrent HTTP requests to prevent overloading the API servers
- **Advanced Diff Classification**: Intelligently categorizes changes as structural (API contract) versus value (data only) with priority ranking
- **Three-Tier Diff Display**: Separates changes into Critical, Structural, and Value changes with collapsible sections
- **Interactive Path Tooltips**: Hover over complex JSON paths to see readable breakdowns and actual values
- **Rich Reporting**: Generates detailed reports with timestamps, response times, and visual diffs
- **Interactive UI**: Filter, search, and explore differences in a user-friendly interface

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CBZ-API-Delta
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all required dependencies:
   - axios (HTTP client)
   - express (Web server)
   - p-limit (Concurrency control)
   - deep-diff (JSON comparison)
   - js-yaml (YAML parsing)
   - cli-progress (Terminal progress bars)
   - readline-sync (CLI input)

3. **Verify Installation**

   ```bash
   # Verify all required files exist
   ls -la config/ src/
   ```

   You should see the following structure:
   ```
   config/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ comparison.yaml
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ endpoints.yaml
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ headers.json
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ids.json
   src/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ comparator.js
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reportGenerator.js
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.js
   ```

## Configuration

Before running comparisons, you may need to modify configuration files:

### 1. Testing IDs (config/ids.json)

Update the IDs used for testing:

```json
{
  "venueId": [31, 80, 11, 154, 50, 380],
  "teamId": [101, 202, 303, 404]
}
```

- Each category (`venueId`, `teamId`, etc.) contains an array of IDs
- IDs are substituted into API paths like `/venues/v1/{venueId}`

### 2. Headers (config/headers.json)

Customize HTTP headers per platform:

```json
{
  "i": {
    "accept": "application/json",
```yaml
- key: "matches-live-v1"
  platform: "i"
  path: "matches/v1/live"
  idCategory: null
- key: "matches-live-v2"
  platform: "i"
  path: "matches/v2/live"
  idCategory: null
```

### Editing comparison.yaml

You can now compare any two endpoints, of any version or environment, by configuring either:
- `endpointPairs` (recommended): Explicitly pairs any two endpoints (e.g., prod v1 vs stg v2, stg v1 vs prod v2, etc.)
- `endpointsToRun` (legacy): Compares the same endpoint (by key) on both sides

#### Example: Compare prod v1 vs stg v2
```yaml
jobs:
  - name: "iOS: Stg v2 vs Prod v1"
    platform: "i"
    baseA: "https://apiserver.cricbuzz.com"
    baseB: "http://api.cricbuzz.stg"
    endpointPairs:
      - endpointA: "matches-live-v1"
        endpointB: "matches-live-v2"
      # ...
```

#### Example: Compare prod v1 vs stg v1 (legacy)
```yaml
jobs:
  - name: "iOS: Prod v1 vs Stg v1"
    platform: "i"
    baseA: "https://apiserver.cricbuzz.com"
    baseB: "http://api.cricbuzz.stg"
    endpointsToRun:
      - matches-live-v1
      - matches-recent-v1
```

- You can mix and match environments (prod/stg), versions (v1/v2), and platforms (i/a/m/w) as needed.
- For each job, set `baseA` and `baseB` to the desired environments, and configure the endpoint keys accordingly.

## Running Comparisons

1. Edit `endpoints.yaml` and `comparison.yaml` as needed for your test scenario.
2. Run the comparison:
   ```bash
   npm run compare
[#########--------------] 45% | 6/14 | ETA: 00:00:08 | Quick Test
```

- Shows percentage complete
- Current tasks completed / total tasks 
- Estimated time remaining
- Current job name

### What Happens During Comparison

1. The tool loads all configuration files
2. For each job defined in comparison.yaml:
   - It filters endpoints to the job's platform
   - For each endpoint ‚Üí ID ‚Üí geo-location combination:
     - Makes HTTP requests to both environments
     - Compares JSON responses using deep-diff
     - Records all metadata (times, headers, etc.)
3. Results are written to a timestamped report folder:
   ```
   reports/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/diff_data.json
   ```

### Stopping a Comparison Run

To stop a running comparison:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel the current process
2. The partial results won't be saved

## Viewing Reports

### Starting the Report Server

```bash
npm run serve
```

This starts an Express server on port 3000.

### Accessing Reports

1. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
2. You'll see a list of available reports by timestamp
3. Click on a report to view it

### Report UI Features

- **Tabs**: Switch between platforms (iOS, Android, Mobile Web, Desktop Web)
- **Search**: Filter by endpoint path, ID, or any text in the response
- **Filter Buttons**: Show All/Errors/Warnings/Failures
- **Endpoint Cards**: Each card shows:
  - Endpoint path with ID
  - Status (‚úì Success, ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning, ‚ùå Error)
- **Diff Classification**: Differences are organized into three collapsible sections:
  - **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Changes**: Highest priority issues (priority ‚â•8) that may break API consumers
  - **üîç Structural Changes**: API contract changes like field additions/removals
  - **üìä Value Changes**: Data-only differences that don't affect API structure

### Path Tooltip System

Complex JSON paths are now enhanced with interactive tooltips:

1. **Hover over any path** (like `typeMatches.3.seriesMatches.2.seriesAdWrapper.matches.1.matchInfo.currBatTeamId`) to see:
   - A hierarchical tree view of the path
   - Array indices clearly marked (e.g., `seriesMatches[3]`)
   - The value that was changed or removed

2. **Descriptive Messages**: All changes include detailed descriptions:
   - Field removals show what type of data was removed (e.g., `wickets = "2"` or `(object with keys: id, name)`) 
   - Array element changes indicate what objects they contained (e.g., `array element containing adDetail was removed`)

## Understanding Diff Classification

The tool now uses an advanced classification system to help you identify critical changes:

### Change Types

- **Structural Changes**: Changes that affect the API contract
  - Field/property additions (`N` kind)
  - Field/property deletions (`D` kind)
  - Array element additions/removals that affect structure
  - Type changes between object and primitive types

- **Value Changes**: Changes that only affect data values
  - Field value edits that don't change structure
  - Array value changes that don't add/remove elements
  - Numeric value changes

### Priority System

Changes are ranked by priority (1-10):

| Priority | Change Type | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| 10 | Critical Structural | Field deletions, especially important objects (like `adDetail`) |
| 8-9 | High Structural | Field additions, major type changes |
| 5-7 | Medium Structural | Array element additions/removals, object‚Üîprimitive conversions |
| 2-4 | Low Structural | Minor type changes |
| 1 | Value | Simple data value changes (especially numeric) |

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Focus on Critical Changes First**: Always expand and review the Critical Changes section first
2. **Check for Missing Fields**: Pay special attention to field deletions (priority 10)
3. **Use Tooltips**: Hover over complex paths to understand the exact location of changes
4. **Examine Context**: For array changes, note which objects were added/removed
  - Geo location and response times
  - Expandable sections for:
    - Full request URLs
    - Headers used
    - Raw JSON responses (prod/staging)
    - Visual diff

### Stopping the Report Server

To stop the report server:

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running
# OR
pkill -f "node src/server.js"
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Endpoint

1. Edit `config/endpoints.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   - key: "new-endpoint-key"
     platform: "i"  # or a, m, w
     path: "/new/path/v1/{categoryId}"
     idCategory: "categoryId"
   ```

2. Ensure the `idCategory` exists in `config/ids.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "categoryId": [1, 2, 3]  # Add if not already present
   }
   ```

3. Add to a job in `config/comparison.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     - name: "Your Job"
       # ...existing config...
       endpointsToRun:
         - "existing-endpoint"
         - "new-endpoint-key"  # Add this line
   ```

### Adding a New Geo-Location

1. Edit `config/headers.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "i": {
       "accept": "application/json",
       "cb-loc": ["IN", "US", "CA", "AE", "UK"],  # Add "UK" here
       # ...other headers...
     },
     # Repeat for other platforms...
   }
   ```

### Creating a New Job

1. Edit `config/comparison.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     # Existing jobs...
     
     # New job:
     - name: "New Platform Test"
       platform: "a"  # For Android
       baseA: "https://apiserver.cricbuzz.com"
       baseB: "https://api.cricbuzz.stg"
       endpointsToRun:
         - "endpoint1"
         - "endpoint2"
       ignorePaths:
         - "meta.timestamp"
       retryPolicy:
         retries: 2
         delayMs: 2000
   ```

### Changing Concurrency Limit

1. Edit `src/comparator.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Find this line (around line 26-30):
   const limit = pLimit(5);  // max 5 parallel comparisons
   
   // Change to your desired limit:
   const limit = pLimit(10); // max 10 parallel comparisons
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "No reports found"

**Problem**: You see "No reports found. Run `npm run compare` first" when accessing http://localhost:3000/reports

**Solution**: You need to generate reports first:
```bash
npm run compare  # Generate at least one report
npm run serve    # Then start the server
```

### "Cannot find module"

**Problem**: Error like `Cannot find module 'cli-progress'`

**Solution**: Reinstall dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Slow Performance

**Problem**: Comparisons are taking too long

**Solutions**:
1. Use quick mode by adding `quickMode: true` to jobs in comparison.yaml
2. Reduce the number of IDs in ids.json
3. Increase concurrency (edit `const limit = pLimit(5)` in comparator.js)
4. Reduce geo locations in headers.json

### Memory Issues

**Problem**: Node.js crashes with "JavaScript heap out of memory"

**Solution**: Increase Node.js memory limit:
```bash
# For comparison
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run compare

# For server
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run serve
```

### Cached Results

**Problem**: You're seeing stale results despite updating the API

**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R in most browsers)
2. Stop and restart the server
3. Delete reports folder and run comparison again

**Problem**: Report shows blank page or "formatChanges is not a function" error

**Solution**:
1. Check your `src/public/main.js` code to ensure it uses `format()` instead of `formatChanges()`:
   ```javascript
   // CORRECT:
   const html = jsondiffpatch.formatters.html.format(d.rawDiff);
   
   // INCORRECT - will cause error:
   // const html = jsondiffpatch.formatters.html.formatChanges(d.rawDiff);
   ```
2. Delete existing report folders: `rm -rf reports/2025-*` 
3. Run a new comparison: `npm run compare`
4. Clear browser cache with hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. Ensure jsondiffpatch CSS styles are included in the HTML template
